## FRC Batteries

FRC uses 12-Volt 18 Amp-Hour Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) batteries. These batteries are the Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) type, which contain fiberglass mats with absorbed battery acid, instead of free-flowing liquid. This reduces the consequences of a spill and results in safer batteries. 

SLA batteries are intended for use in lower current applications, with nominal outputs between 1 and 15 amps and can last many years in these conditions. Under FRC conditions, which average around 50-60 amps continuous through the match, batteries tend to last 1-2 years before becoming unsuitable for matches.

!!! danger "Battery Safety"
    While AGM batteries are safer than free-flowing liquid batteries, battery acid is still an extremely strong acid, as well as being highly toxic. If a battery is dropped, cracked, or you see any white powdery residue on it, dispose of the battery safely following your team's battery disposal procedures. See the [Battery Disposal](#battery-disposal) section for more information.

### 1. Anderson SB Connectors
There are two types of Anderson SB connectors permitted for use as FRC battery connectors; the SB50 and SB120. The SB50 is the most common, and is rated for 6AWG wire. By swaging the connector it is possible to use with 4AWG, but switching to an SB120 is recommended in that case. SB50 connectors are used on batteries from FRC spares kits, as well as those that come as part of the rookie kit of parts. SB120 connectors are rated for 6AWG, 4AWG, and 2AWG wire depending on the size of contact purchased.

SB connectors are color coded, and do not interconnect between colors. For the SB50, red is the most common color. For the SB120, blue is the most common color. Using a less common color may prevent borrowing or sharing batteries with other teams.

### 2. Battery Wires
The most common wire gauge for FRC battery wires is 6AWG. 4AWG and 2AWG are also permitted, and provide slight benefits to conductivity, increasing the amount of usable power for the robot. Using EPDM welding cable is recommended, as it's extremely flexible and cut resistant, [Powerwerx](https://powerwerx.com/welding-cable-epdm) sells this type of cable in 6AWG, 4AWG, and 2AWG gauges.

If you don't want to cut and crimp the wires yourself, AndyMark sells pre-made battery cables in [6AWG](https://andymark.com/products/6-gauge-12-inch-battery-cable?variant=44497405870252) and [4AWG](https://andymark.com/products/4-gauge-battery-cable), as well as configurable [Robot Power Cable Kits](https://andymark.com/products/robot-power-cable-kit-custom-lengths-up-to-36-in) that cover the entire system.

When designing your robot, you want to minimize the battery wire length to the power distribution board as much as possible. This reduces resistance, and allows for more effective power.

!!! warning
    While Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) wire is allowed, it is not recommended. For the same wire diameter CCA wire has a higher resistance and will waste significantly more power as heat, leading to worse performance and hotter wires.

### 3. Lugs and Connection
FRC battery terminals are designed for use with lugs compatible with #10 or M5 screw holes. Lugs must be sized appropriately for the wire gauge being used. Depending on your battery orientation, you may want to use a straight or right angle lug. Once crimped, the lug should be attached to the battery terminal using locking hardware. 

The best option is the Grasshopper nut, which provides an extremely secure connection that resists loosening under vibration. Grasshopper nuts can be purchased from [The Thrifty Bot](https://www.thethriftybot.com/products/grasshopper-nut), or made yourself using this [forming tool](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fd2d9412535523e7783f88ba/w/d2d16c539f14e2ce19b152b7/e/58dd4fa889f825cfdecfe609). If you cannot use a Grasshopper nut with Nord-Lock washers, a #10-32 screw with washers and a nylock nut is the next best option. 

![Grasshopper Nut](/assets/Battery/grasshopper-nut.png){ width="50%" }

!!! warning "Included Hardware"
    The hardware that comes with the battery at purchase is usually extremely low quality, and may loosen during matches, leading to a faulty connection and loss of power. It's is highly recommended to replace them with better hardware.

### 4. The Battery
The most commonly used batteries in FRC are the MK Battery ES17-12, the Duracell DURA12-18NB, and the Energizer EN18-12. These can be purchased from FRC vendors, or from most automotive vendors. If purchasing batteries in person, check the date of manufacture. Batteries that have sat on the shelf for a long period of time may have lost some of their total capacity. To understand what specs make a battery legal, please see [R601](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/robot-construction-rules-(r)#r601-battery-limit-everyone-has-the-same-power).

## Crimping and Assembly
Both the lugs and SB-series connectors need to be correctly crimped with enough force to solidify the stranded wire within the lug. To do this, there are a few crimper options that provide good crimps. The cross section of a correctly crimped wire should look like the left image below, with the strands compressed into each other. The right image shows a poorly crimped wire, which may lead to connection failure and increased resistance.

A good way to check your crimps is the "tug test", where post crimp you pull on the connection to see if it moves on the wire. If any movement occurs, it was not crimped properly.

Securing the cables with clip-on zip tie mounts is heavily recommended, as it reduces the amount of stress on the lug connections, as well as on the SB50. You can purchase them from DigiKey, as [Panduit SKU MCMS12-P-C](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panduit-corp/MCMS12-P-C/1306790).

### Battery Assembly Steps
1. Cut both wires to the desired length. 12" is a good length to start with, but you should only make them as long as you need to easily connect the battery to the robot.
+ Strip insulation off the ends to the spec for that connector. For lugs, this is the length of the barrel, with a minimum amount of uninsulated wire sticking out. For SB-series connectors, this is **9/16" (14mm)** for SB50 connectors, and **15/16" (24mm)** for SB120 connectors. While stripping the cable, be careful not to cut any strands. This can reduce current carrying performance.
+ Crimp the lugs and SB-series connectors using the appropriate crimper and die for your wire gauge, as mentioned above. In the case of using a crimper with metric mm² dies, you can use an online tool to [convert AWG to mm²](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/wire/awg-to-mm.html). <br/> <!-- Adds line break while keeping text inside list number -->
In the images below, on the left you can see an example of flashing, where the die has squeezed some of the metal out of the crimp. In small amounts, like in the image, this is okay, but larger flashing can lead to poor connection quality. <br/> <!-- Adds line break while keeping image inside list number -->
  ![Mild Flashing](/assets/Battery/mild-flashing.jpg){ width="50%" }
+ Use heat shrink tubing to cover the barrel of the lug. Do not cover the flat mating surfaces, and do not apply heat shrink to the SB-series connector. Clear heat shrink is recommended so you can easily assess the lug connection.
+ Insert the pins into the SB-series connector housing, and ensure they are fully seated. The bent tip of the contact should be pushed in front of the spring in the connector housing, retaining the contact. Be sure that the black cable is inserted into the port marked "-" and the red cable is inserted into the port marked "+".
+ Connect the lugs to the battery terminals using a Grasshopper nut, or #10 screw with washers and a nylock nut. Be careful not to over-tighten the connection, as this can damage the battery terminal and cause battery leakage. <br/> <!-- Adds line break while keeping image inside list number -->
  ![Battery Terminal Leak](/assets/Battery/battery-oxidation.JPEG){ width="50%" }
+ Use heatshrink or electrical tape to cover all exposed metal on the battery terminals, and if possible use the clips mentioned in [Crimping and Assembly](#crimping-and-assembly) to provide strain relief for the battery wires.

## Charging and Maintenance
In FRC, you are permitted to charge batteries at up to 6 amps. ([R604](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/robot-construction-rules-(r)#r604-charge-batteries-at-a-safe-rate)). This limit comes from the battery manufacturer datasheets, and is intended to prevent overheating of the batteries during charging.

Any charger for 12V Sealed Lead Acid batteries, as long as it meets the above rule, can be used. There are some chargers, listed below, which are pre-made with FRC connectors and which are the most common in the FRC community. You can purchase them with either SB50 or SB120 connectors. NOCO Genius chargers have a de-sulfation mode, which can help extend battery life.

!!! warning "Battery Storage"
    Leaving batteries uncharged for long periods of time is not recommended, and can permanently reduce the capacity of the battery. If you are storing batteries for long periods of time, either keep them on a charger in maintenance mode (automatic on most chargers), or charge them every 1-2 months to keep them in good condition.

### Measuring Battery Life
There are multiple ways with differing levels of accuracy to measure the remaining life of a battery. The quickest, and what should be done before every match is to use a Battery Beak, [sold by CTRE](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/battery-beak), to measure the charge state and internal resistance of the battery. For match batteries, under 15 milliohms is ideal, while for practice batteries under 20 milliohms is acceptable. Above 20 milliohms the battery will produce significant amounts of heat, and should be retired from heavy use.

For more in-depth measurements to track battery health, you can purchase a [Computerized Battery Analyzer](https://andymark.com/products/computerized-battery-analyzer?variant=44493455884460) (CBA). Computerized Battery Analyzers work by artificially discharging the battery at a known rate, usually around 10 amps, and can provide measurements of the battery status over time. When using a CBA, it is important to run a couple baseline tests before heavy use of the battery, as the tests are best used to relate to previous tests, rather than to provide an absolute measurement of the battery's health. A cheaper option than a CBA is an automotive Cold Cranking Amps tester, but these test a very different aspect than what FRC uses, and so can be misleading unless only used as a comparison against previous tests on the same battery.

Another method that may help to measure battery life is the [Battery Fuel Gauge](https://www.playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?pdid=264&catid=1014) from Playing with Fusion. This device replaces the wires on your battery and provides both on-device readings of lifespan and charge, as well as a CAN interface to read the data live from your robot. Using this device effectively requires purchasing one per battery, and keeping it on for it's entire lifespan. Each device will adaptively learn the battery's lifespan characteristics, and if a battery is discharged without using the BFG it may not provide accurate readings. 
## Battery Disposal
Per the *FIRST* FRC Safety Manual, all teams are required to have a box of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), acid-resistant rubber gloves, and a suitable plastic container to carry the defective battery in. If a battery should spill, use these items to clean up the battery. If you get any on your hands or eyes, or feel a burning sensation, flush the contacted skin with water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention.

Once a battery is no longer usable, either due to damage or age, you need to dispose of it properly. Lead Acid batteries are considered hazardous waste in most jurisdictions, and must be disposed of properly. If the battery is undamaged, most auto-parts stores, like AutoZone, will accept them for recycling and give you a small gift card in return. 

If the battery is cracked, leaking, or otherwise damaged, search for your jurisdiction's hazardous waste disposal program, and follow their instructions for delivering it to a hazardous waste site. 

## Best Practices
- Always identify, by writing on the battery itself, a unique name or number for the battery, as well as when the battery was first used. This will help track battery life and performance. 
- Never pick up a battery by the wires. It can significantly stress the connections and lead to failure.
- Rotate between a set of batteries in matches, preventing overuse of a single battery. This will help extend the life of your batteries, and ensure your batteries are charged in time for your next match.
